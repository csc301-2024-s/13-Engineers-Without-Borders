## BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
Although the final product will be a mobile app, including iOS, building to iOS is a pain and it wasn't worth it for a prototype like this.
We opted to only build to Android, and a Windows executable for convenience.

Simple navigate to `D2/Builds` and:
- For the Windows build, run `Windows/Green Revolution.exe`
- For the Android build, open `Android/Green Revolution.apk` in an emulator

## USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
- Upon opening, you should see the market screen. You should see a big list of items you can buy
    - You can scroll this list
- Click on an item to buy it
    - Some items don't do anything (yet) and will be implemented in the future
    - Greyed out items means you either don't have enough money or have already bought the maximum amount
- You can sell wheat in quantities of one or ten
- Click on the MANAGE FARM button at the bottom to go to the farm management screen
- Here, you can manage your individual plots. Each green square represents a plot, and you can toggle whether that plot has HYC seeds and the type of fertilizer it has
- There are a few buttons at the bottom, none of them do anything (yet) except the market button, which takes you back to the market
