## BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
Although the final product will be a mobile app, including iOS, building to iOS is a pain and it wasn't worth it for a prototype like this.
We opted to only build to Android, and a Windows executable for convenience.

Simple navigate to `D2/Builds` and open the corresponding Windows exec in the Windows folder, or import the Android project into Android studio.
