## BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
Although the final product will be a mobile app, we decided to build a simple Windows executable for this deliverable, since we don't want the tester to go through the trouble of getting an emulator for what's only a protoype. Don't worry, Unity makes it very easy to switch between target platforms.

Simple navigate to `D2/Build` and open the `D3` executable.
